# Neuroad UI - Train Your MLP Through The Browser
The project was previously deployed on Heroku but currently is not deployed anywhere. The repository of the MLP API is [this one](https://github.com/auhide/mlp_nn). 

You can see a walkthrough video of the full project below:

## Pages

### `Home`
Page with animations describing what this website is capable of.
### `Learn`
This is the page in which you can learn the maths behind the Forward and Backward propagation of a Neural Network. The formulas are accompanied by many animations for each stage of the training.
### `Config`
Here you can tune the Multilayer Perceptron hyperparameters, start a training session and then evaluate your model. You can also download the model weights.
### `Data`
Before training your model you should choose a dataset. This is the page you can visit to do that. Each dataset has a $2D$ representation generated with PCA. 

You can also get the significance of each feature and then choose the most significant ones. Again, this is powered by PCA.
